**How to Download the Newest**   
**London Roblox Template** 

In order to allow workshop authors to dynamically update the Roblox project, there is now a Windows-friendly app built to retrieve it with a click of a button. It’s highly recommended to download this app to all workshop computers. That way, instructors can easily retrieve a fresh Roblox project, especially in-between sessions.

**1\.** Download the app from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15FaWXH8FdRFN0yB8toCyC-MPHHdxHK7w/view?usp=sharing). 

**2\.** Unzip the file, and navigate through until you see a file called: **update-roblox.exe** 

**3\.** Double-click the file to run. The first time you open it, Microsoft Defender will alert you because when the app was packaged, it wasn’t signed with a certificate. Click Run Anyways. 

**4\.** Click anywhere on the app window to download the .rbxl file. The app will let you choose where to download it and notify you when it’s successful.

**5\.** Double-click the downloaded Roblox file to open\! Note that this only works if Roblox Studio is already downloaded.

**6\.** If possible, pin this app to the taskbar so that it's easy for volunteers to use it when resetting the Roblox project.
