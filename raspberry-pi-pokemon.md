## Gotta Catch â€˜Em All! Raspberry Pi and Java Pokemon Training

Description: The Pokemon have escaped the laboratory and are running amuck! Using a miniature Raspberry Pi computer, a 3D printed pokeball, and the Java programming language, you can catch all of the escaped Pokeman and return them to the professor. For this workshop hardware will be provided, but we recommend that you purchase your own Raspberry Pi to continue catching Pokemon at home!
