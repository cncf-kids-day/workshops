## Animating Phippy and Friends on the Micro:bit

Description: The micro:bit is a small embedded board that has everything you need to create fun projects. It has LEDs to display pictures, buttons, and sensors that you can control using block coding or Python. In this workshop we will program the micro:bit to draw the CNCF mascot characters, Phippy and Friends, and use animation and sound to create a fun little game.
