# Kids Day @ KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, Paris 2024

## LEARNING AI WITH PHIPPY THE GIRAFFE

Children are already learning how to use AI and ChatGPT technology to assist them with their homework, but how do you make your own AI model? Help Phippy, the cloud-native giraffe, to invite all his friends to Zee’s birthday party by using AI technologies to help recognize his friends. In this workshop you will learn how machine learning algorithms work, create a Scratch program to run an AI model, and test the recognition performance of the model using a web camera.

## MINECRAFT MODDING

Every child loves Minecraft Modifying (modding) Minecraft requires some basic computer skills but can then unleash their creativity. Through mods, kids can create characters, special effects, and bring their imagination to a game they already love playing. The CNCF community will bring our passion for technology and inclusion to children local to Paris. As an outcome, attendees will learn basic computer skills, apply their creativity, and hopefully be inspired by technology and heard by technologists.

## PHIPPY AND FRIENDS RASPBERRY PI ZOO RESCUE

The Pods from the zoo escaped and stole all the containers from Captain Kube’s ship! Goldie, Zee, and other friends were hiding inside the containers and now they have gone missing. Help Phippy chase down all the Pods, return the containers to Captain Kube, and rescue his friends.

To save Phippy’s friends you will need to use a Raspberry Pi and wire up various sensors that can help you to capture the elusive Pods. Hardware will be provided for this workshop, but we recommend that you purchase your own Raspberry Pi to continue deploying containers at home!
