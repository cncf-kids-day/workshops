##MINECRAFT MODDING

Description: Every child loves Minecraft Modifying (modding) Minecraft requires some basic computer skills but can then unleash their creativity. Through mods, kids can create characters, special effects, and bring their imagination to a game they already love playing. The CNCF community will bring our passion for technology and inclusion to children local to Paris. As an outcome, attendees will learn basic computer skills, apply their creativity, and hopefully be inspired by technology and heard by technologists.
