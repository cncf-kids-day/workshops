# PHIPPY AND FRIENDS RASPBERRY PI ZOO RESCUE

Description: The Pods from the zoo escaped and stole all the containers from Captain Kube’s ship! Goldie, Zee, and other friends were hiding inside the containers and now they have gone missing. Help Phippy chase down all the Pods, return the containers to Captain Kube, and rescue his friends. To save Phippy’s friends you will need to use a Raspberry Pi and wire up various sensors that can help you to capture the elusive Pods. Hardware will be provided for this workshop, but we recommend that you purchase your own Raspberry Pi to continue deploying containers at home!
