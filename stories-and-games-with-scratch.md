## Stories and Games with Scratch

Description: Kids can create interactive stories, games, and animations by programming with Scratch. Through fun exercises, kids will learn the basics of how to get started with the Scratch programming language. We will have kids engage in design activities using sprites and blocks and show personal creativity by solving problems. At the end of the workshop, they will be able to share their creations with other attendees as well as others in the online community.
